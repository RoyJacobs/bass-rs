# bass-rs

An extremely basic, tiny and unsafe wrapper around [Bass](https://www.un4seen.com/bass.html).

It currently only wraps the functions needed to play, pause and seek in a stream.

I have written it for my own use and currently have zero interest in extending it to be a general purpose Bass wrapper, sorry :)
